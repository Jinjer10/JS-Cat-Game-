            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            
            <p class="w">Welcome to the exciting world of Whisker Wizard, guardian of the enchanted thicket! Your mission is to defeat the monsters, and protect the thicket. Here's how to navigate this action-packed adventure:
                Controls:
                Use the left and right arrow keys to maneuver your character across the screen.
                Press the up arrow key to jump forward.
                To defeat the monsters that stand in your way use the Enter key to perform a quick roll.
                share:
                Every monster you kill earns you a precious point.
                You must earn at least 50 cleans in the time limit to win a stage
                Note that at each stage the conditions are slightly different
                In stage 1 you have 60 seconds and 5 hearts to complete the mission
                In stage 2 you have 30 seconds and 4 hearts and in stage 3 only 20 seconds and 3 hearts
                Strive for the highest possible score in each stage to establish dominance.
                Maintenance:
                Be ware of monster attacks! Crashing into them in a situation other than diving or rolling will damage your health.
                Lose all your hearts and it's over.
                Have you finished a phase or are you eager for a new start? Just press the "R" key to reset.
                and start the step again or "E" to return to the home screen.
                When you're ready to dive back in, grab control and set off on your journey to victory!
                Gear up, activate your skills and get ready to conquer another stage. The fate of the thicket is in your hands. Good luck!</p>
